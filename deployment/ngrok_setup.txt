# ngrok_setup.txt

## Purpose
This file explains how to deploy the **Heart Disease Prediction Streamlit App** locally and make it publicly accessible using **Ngrok**.

---

## 1. Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+ installed  
- Streamlit installed (`pip install streamlit`)  
- Ngrok installed ([https://ngrok.com/download](https://ngrok.com/download))  
- Project dependencies installed from `requirements.txt`  

---

## 2. Run the Streamlit App Locally
Navigate to the `ui/` folder and run:

```bash
cd ui
streamlit run app.py

---

## 3. Start Ngrok Tunnel

In a new terminal, run:
```bash
ngrok http 8501


---

## 4. Share the Public Link

- Copy the HTTPS Ngrok URL.

- Share it with others to allow live access to the app.

## 5. Notes
- Keep both terminals open (Streamlit + Ngrok) for the app to remain accessible.

- Each time you restart Ngrok, a new public URL is generated (unless you use a paid Ngrok plan with reserved domains).
